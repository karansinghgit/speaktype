## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **OS** | macOS 13.0+ (Ventura or newer) |
| **Architecture** | Apple Silicon (M1+) recommended |
| **Storage** | 2GB free (for AI models) |
| **Permissions** | Microphone & Accessibility |

### Option 1: Download Pre-built App (Recommended)

**📥 [Download Latest Release](https://github.com/yourusername/speaktype/releases/latest)**

1. Download `SpeakType.dmg` from the latest release
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag **SpeakType** to your **Applications** folder
4. **First time only:** Right-click the app → Select **"Open"** → Click **"Open"** again
   
   > ⚠️ **Why right-click?** This app is not yet notarized by Apple (requires paid developer account). Right-clicking bypasses Gatekeeper. This is safe - you can review the source code yourself!

5. Grant permissions when prompted (Microphone + Accessibility)
6. Download an AI model from Settings → AI Models

**That's it!** 🎉 Press `⌥ Space` (Option + Space) to start dictating.

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speaktype.git
cd speaktype

# 2. Build & run
make build
make run

# Or open in Xcode
open speaktype.xcodeproj
```

### First Time Setup

1. **Grant Permissions** (you'll be prompted):
   - 🎤 Microphone access for recording
   - ♿ Accessibility access for auto-paste

2. **Download AI Model**:
   - Open SpeakType → AI Models
   - Click "Download" on Whisper Base (550MB)
   - Wait for download to complete

3. **Configure Hotkey** (optional):
   - Go to Settings
   - Default is `⌥ Space` (Option + Space)
   - Customize to your preference

4. **Start Using**:
   - Press hotkey anywhere
   - Speak naturally
   - Release = text appears!

---

## 💡 Usage

### Basic Usage

```
1. Press hotkey (⌥ Space)
2. Speak your text
3. Release hotkey
4. ✨ Text appears!
```

### Examples

**Writing an Email**
```
Press hotkey → "Hi team comma I wanted to share the latest updates period"

### Architecture

SpeakType follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern with clean separation:

- **Models**: Data structures (`AIModel`, `TranscriptionResult`)
- **Views**: SwiftUI UI components
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management  
- **Services**: Core functionality (audio, transcription, clipboard)

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Language** | Swift 5.9+ |
| **UI** | SwiftUI + AppKit |
| **AI** | [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) 0.9.4 |
| **Audio** | AVFoundation |
| **Hotkeys** | [KeyboardShortcuts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts) |
| **State** | Combine + SwiftUI |

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Build & run
make build          # Build debug
make run            # Run app
make clean          # Clean build artifacts

# Distribution
make package        # Create ZIP for distribution
make dmg            # Create DMG installer
make release        # Create both ZIP and DMG

# Testing
make test           # Run all tests
make test-unit      # Unit tests only
make test-ui        # UI tests only

# Logging
make logs           # View live logs
make logs-errors    # Recent errors only
make logs-export    # Export to Desktop

# Code quality
make lint           # Run SwiftLint
make format         # Auto-fix issues
```

### Creating a Release

Want to publish a new version? It's automated!

```bash
# 1. Update version in Xcode project
# 2. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Release v1.0.0"

# 3. Create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0

# 4. GitHub Actions will automatically:
#    - Build the app
#    - Create DMG and ZIP files
#    - Create a GitHub release
#    - Upload the files
```

**Or build locally:**
```bash
make release
# Files will be in dist/ folder
```

### Logging & Debugging

SpeakType uses Apple's **unified logging system** with categories:

```swift
// In your code
import Foundation

AppLogger.info("Started recording", category: .audio)
AppLogger.success("Transcription complete", category: .transcription)
AppLogger.error("Download failed", error: error, category: .models)
```

**View logs in terminal:**
```bash
# Live stream
make logs

# Filter by category
log stream --predicate 'process == "speaktype" AND category == "Transcription"'

# Export for debugging
make logs-export
```

### Code Guidelines

- ✅ Use MVVM pattern
- ✅ Write SwiftUI views, not UIKit
- ✅ Add unit tests for services
- ✅ Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- ✅ Use `AppLogger` instead of `print()`

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### WhisperKit Dependency Warnings

You may see these build warnings:
```
warning: 'WhisperKit' is missing a dependency on 'TensorUtils'
warning: 'WhisperKit' is missing a dependency on 'Hub'
warning: 'WhisperKit' is missing a dependency on 'Tokenizers'
```

**These are harmless** and come from Xcode's dependency scanner analyzing WhisperKit's internal structure. They don't affect functionality—your app builds and runs perfectly. This is a limitation of WhisperKit 0.9.4, not your code.
